# ShopBro-2.0-mobile
The react-native mobile app version of our ShopBro2.0-Web app.

## About 
We are currently using React-Native and Expo XDE to build our mobile applicaiton of ShopBro. 
We chose Expo XDE to allow for our app to be used across both Android and iOS operating systems.

## Our Tools
We are currently using React-Native, EXPO, Redux, JWT (For social authentication) - to build this app.

## Commented code for Team
Team - to keep our mobile app running efficiently as possible, I (Engie) have created a 'commented-out-for-team' branch with comments I made during the days of our Final Project at EDA (May 2018).  If you're wanting to know how our React-Native app has been constructed - please refer to the comments in this branch.
